You must right a programme that will simulate a game of life. the prototype 
of this program is the following :
./life width height iteration

Width and eight are the dimentions of the board and iterations is the number 
of iteration of the game life.

the initial configuration of the board will be drawn by a  sequence of 
commands in the standard input.
Imagine a pen starting in the top left corner of the board. Each command is
one of these characteres :
w a s d -> move the pen up, left, bottom and right
x -> lift or lower the pen in order to start or stop drawing.
(when used whith 'echo', you can ignore the \n)
Once end of life is reached, your program must simulate a game of life on 
this board and print the result on the standard out (each cell alive will be
represented by a '0' and dead by a space)
each cell outside of the array will be considered dead

exemple :

$>echo 'sdxddssaaww' | ./a.out 3 3 0 | cat -e
   $
000$
0 0$

$>echo 'dxss' | ./a.out 3 3 0 | cat -e

 $>echo 'dxsss' | ./a.out 3 3 1 | cat -e
