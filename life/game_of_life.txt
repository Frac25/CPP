The universe of the game of life is an infinite, two-dimentionnal
orthogonal grid of square cells, each of witch is in one of two 
possible state live or dead (or pupulated and unpopulated, respectively).
Every cell interacts whith its eight neighbours, witch are the cells that are
horizontally, vertically or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, 
the following transition occur :
-Any line cell with fewer than 2 live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation
-Any live cell whith 2 or 3 live neighbours lives on to the next generation
-Any live cell whith more than 3 live neighbous dies, as if by overpopulation
-Any dead cell whith exactly 3 live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction
The rules, whith compare the behaviour of the automation to real life, can be 
condensed into the following :

Any live cell whith 2 or 3 live neighbours survive
Any dead cell whith 3 live neighbours become a live cell
Any other live cells die in the next generation. similary all other dead cells stay dead.

The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the systeme
The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to
every cell in the seed, live or dead ; births ans deaths occure simultaneously, and the 
discrete moment at witch this happens is sometime call tick. Each generation is a pure 
fonction of the preceding one. The rule continue ti be applied repeatedly to create 
further generations
