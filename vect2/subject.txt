vect2
Expected file : vect2.cpp vect2.hpp

Create a class vect2 representing a mathematical vector of dimention 2 containing ints.
It must support addition, substarction and multiplication by a scalar (such as the expression
(vect2(2,2) * 2 == vect2(4,4)) is true).

The operator[] can be used to access the component of your vector (whith 0 and 1),
no bound checking is required

Your fonction must be printable whith the << operator such as :
std::cout << v << std::endl;
produce the same output as :
s << "{" << v[0] << ", "<< v[1] << "}"<< std:endl

You will find a main in this directory that must work whith your class.
