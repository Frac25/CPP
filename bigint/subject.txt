asignement name : bigint
Expected file : bigint.cpp bigint.hpp

In computer science, a bignum is an object representing an arbitrary precision
number, this is useful when you want ti store a number bigger that SIZE_MAX
whithout any loss of precision. This is often achieved by storing an array or a string
containing the different "parts"of the number.
Create a class called bigint that will store an arbitrary precision unsigned integer
Your class must support addition, comparaison and "digitshift"(like bitshift
but instead ofshifting bits you will shift the digit in base 10, e.g :
(42<<3 == 4200) ans (1337>>2 == 13)).
Your bigint must be printable whith the << operator (in base 10) and the output
should not contain any leading zeros.
You will find a main in directory that must work whith your class.
